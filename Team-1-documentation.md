Our web-based system will be catered towards college students “StudyIt”. As a college student, there is a large sum of us that at some point in our education, were stuck. Sometimes, we have a friend studying late with us in the library, or someone we can text, that is there to help us. However, there are other times where we find ourselves alone, everyone is asleep or there are no friends in class. Our website is meant to combat this.

Studying users will be able to log in, personalize their profile, and indicate their location as well as what they are studying for. The MVP will only cater to specific locations on campus, such as the Student Center, the Library, the Instructional Center, etc…

A special chat and call option will allow students to connect with others in the same location that are seeking a study buddy, help, or company. Specific locations of each user will not be disclosed to others, only the general area and number of students there (in the same class).

Another user profile will include TA’s, where they can upload study sessions happening that week, allowing study users to have access to more resources and TA users to have higher engagement rates. This will be open to student users who are also hosting active study sessions and would like to take part in a group setting.
